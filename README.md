This GitHub repository contains a Python script for managing symbolic links in Linux systems. Symbolic links, also known as symlinks, are used for easy file access and managing different versions of the same library. The script provides functionality for creating and deleting symbolic links, as well as generating a summary report of existing symbolic links.

The script utilizes the 'os' module for system-related operations and offers a user-friendly menu interface. Users can create a symbolic link by specifying the target file or path, with the option to confirm or cancel the operation. Similarly, deleting a symbolic link requires the user to enter the link's filename, followed by confirmation. The summary report option generates a table displaying the symbolic link number, link name, and target path in the /home directory.

This Python code provides an efficient way to handle symbolic links and can be a valuable tool for system administrators or developers working with Linux systems.
